# sandtimer-gpt4
A sandtimer entirely programmed by gpt4 (either ChatGPT or Co-Pilot X)

The ultimate goal is to have a working sand timer with particules physics.

I'm not a javascript developper. I do have some experience with this language but it is limited. 
I have no experience with any engine. Physics or game engine.

This is more of an experimentation then a proper application.
